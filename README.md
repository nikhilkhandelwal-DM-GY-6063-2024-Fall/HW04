**This is a submission of Homework for Week 3 Part A and Part B.**

This repository contains a p5.js sketch that generates 2 sketches 2 emphasizes the randomness and visual diversity introduced in the grid layout of circle and sketch 2 is Wall Drawing inspired by Sol LeWitt's Wall Drawing. 

**PART A**

Randomness and visual diversity introduced in the grid layout of circle of different sizes and colors.

Canvas Setup: The canvas is set to fill the entire window, with a soft beige background (rgb(235, 214, 200)) to contrast with the dynamic colored circles.

Grid Pattern with Randomness: Circles are placed in a grid pattern, but each circle's fill color and size are randomized. The fill color is generated using random RGB values (random(0, 255)), creating a unique color palette for every circle.

Size Variability: The size of each circle is varied randomly between 20 and 80 pixels, adding visual interest and breaking uniformity in the grid.

Offset Positioning: Each circle's position is slightly offset (+25 pixels) from its grid point, introducing a subtle randomness to the layout, giving it an organic feel.

**PART B**

Wall Drawing #65

Lines not short, not straight, crossing and touching, drawn at random, using four colors, uniformly dispersed with maximum density, covering the entire surface of the wall.

Canvas Setup: The canvas is created to cover the full browser window, with a white background (rgb(255, 255, 255)), providing a clean backdrop for the colorful lines.

Color Palette: Four primary colors are defined (Red, Green, Blue, and Orange) and stored in an array. Each line is drawn using a randomly selected color from this predefined palette, ensuring variation in the visual design.

Randomized Lines: The program generates 500 lines, each with randomized properties:

- Stroke Color: Each line is assigned a random color from the palette.
- Stroke Weight: The thickness of each line is randomly set between 1 and 5 pixels.
- Start and End Points: The x and y coordinates of each line are randomly generated   making the lines span across different parts of the canvas.
